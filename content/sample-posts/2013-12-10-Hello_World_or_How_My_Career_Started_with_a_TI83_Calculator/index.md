The [Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program) text is synonymous, for developers, with the start of a new project, and often a new technology. The simple phrase has a long history as a starting block for software development and testing.

## A Personal Journey

My first experience with coding and development was in the fourth grade. Every month my school would hand out a short packet from Scholastic with books and other items for sale (a brilliant way for Scholastic and the school to make some money off kids, right!). In one catalogue I discovered a computer “game” which would teach kids the programming language BASIC while building video games.

As a kid who loved playing video games and was into art I jumped at the chance to get into the world that I loved so much. My parents were supportive in my effort and purchased the software for me.

However, the program was a huge disappointment to me. The program came with pre-built games for testing and editing as well as the ability to build from scratch, but there was a dichotomy in what was being taught. On one end of the spectrum you could modify snippets of pre-existing game code to change gameplay functionality (variables like speed, names, and numbers), or you could attempt to build a brand new game from scratch. There was no <em>how</em>, no lesson plans, no building up of knowledge.

As can be imagined my dreams of building lightsaber games and RPGs were crushed. I played around with the program for a while but quickly became bored and frustrated.

## The Story Continues

My second run in with development came with the availability of the internet in our house and a fascination with the World Wide Web. I discovered that it was possible to create a personal website and put it online for the world to see, cool! But I had no idea how to make this happen, and my attempts did not get far or last long.

The only way I knew to create a website at the time was with Microsoft Word, so that was my medium. The few websites I created (none were ever online) were basic, simple text and table based designs, mostly about video games and comic books.

## An Unexpected Breakthrough

High school introduced a new subject in my life that would forever change me, and it wasn’t geometry, chemistry, art class, or music - it was the TI83 Plus Graphing Calculator, required for all high school math classes and the bane of many teachers. I can honestly say that I may not be the person I am today if it was not for the TI83 graphing calculator.

The TI83 graphing calculator was like the iPhone to the pre-iPhone generation. It had all the necessities that made it useful in a classroom, like calculations, graphing points, complex math - as well as offering students other illicit activities like stashing text documents with answers and playing video games, many of which I played. But the most important game was Drug Wars.

Drugs Wars was a text based game, unlike most games, and therefore it was possible to open the program and read the source code. The first steps of exploration were changing the source code - names and variables - as I gained familiarity with the programing language.

As my knowledge of the TI83 programing language grew I began building simple programs to run math equations, work chemistry problems, and then build games. Often times I would spend my time in math class writing programs to do exactly what the teacher was covering at the moment. And the crazy thing is that I usually understood the subject better because of the programs I created. I had one teacher, Mr. Taylor for Chemistry, who actually encouraged us to use our TI83 to create programs that would automate what we were learning.

Of course I didn’t only write useful programs for the classroom, my other creations included:

1. The Matrix "Virus" - I created a *virus* for the TI83 which, when run, would output strings of zeros and ones, similar to the screens on The Matrix, in a never ending loop. The device would seem to not function, but the program could be ended by pressing the Esc button.
1. Harvest Moon - I was a big Harvest Moon fan, so I built a TI83 Harvest Moon/Drug Wars mashup. The game was similar to Drug Wars in that it was a turn based game. The player would decide what crops to plant and sell before, make money, and pay off a loan.
1. Chrono Trigger RPG - My greatest creation was an RPG like battle game. I built a turn based battle system with four different characters, items, magic, health points, attacks, defense, the works! It was crazy, and I spent an entire semester of gym classes writing notes and pushing code on my TI83.

## A Robot Teacher

So what is the take away from this little story? It’s that sometimes the most influential factor is not the direct course work but an unexpected sideshow. Did I learn geometry and history and chemistry in highschool? Some, yes, but 10 years later how beneficial has it been to me and what percent of the knowledge have I retained? Very little.

But my obsession with the TI83 did ignite a spark in me that lead me down a path to my future studies in college and later a career that I love. I could say more about the TI83 as an educational device but instead I will direct you to a great article by Phil Nichols entitled [Go Ahead, Mess With Texas Instruments](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/go-ahead-mess-with-texas-instruments/278899/). Phil outlines his history with the TI83, its impact on his future, and talks about modifying the TI83 Mario game.

I know many others have had similar experience with the TI83 as an educational tool, including [Dann Berg](http://www.iamdann.com/2012/09/13/writing-my-first-code-and-mastering-the-ti-83-plus-graphing-calculator).
