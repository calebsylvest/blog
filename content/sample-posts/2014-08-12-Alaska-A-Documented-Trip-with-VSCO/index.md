I recently returned from an excellent adventure in Alaska. The journey began with a flight to Vancouver, BC and onto a cruise ship sailing up the coast of Alaska, making several stops along the way. I can definitely recommend taking a cruise through Alaska if you ever choose to make the visit.

The following are a smattering of my photos from the trips, if you would like to see my account of the full photo journey (and other adventures), check out my VSCO page where I post the best-of-the-best photos from my explorations.
