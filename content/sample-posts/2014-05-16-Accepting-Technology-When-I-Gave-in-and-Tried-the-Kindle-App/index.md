Hearing someone berate new inventions and tools always surprises me, whether it's the rise of the smartphone, Google Glass, or an all-electric automobile. I typically think of myself as open to change and accepting of new tools, at least enough to try them out or give them time to prove themselves in the real world.

But one technology I've never understood is the market of digital e-books. For one, I never understood why someone would spend a couple hundred dollars for a device to read books on, when you could get an iPad or other tablet for a bit more with much more possibility (yes, I understand the e-ink thing). And, I like books. I like to read and enjoy the feeling of paper in my hand and turning pages.

On a side note, but on technology, I would like to share a tweet of a photo from a powerpoint by <a href="http://www.douglasadams.com/">Douglas Adams</a>, which should help explain the techno-human condition.

I'd say he's about spot on!

<h2>My Foray to the World of Digital Literature</h2>

Recently I vacationed with my family in Yosemite and San Francisco (highly recommended). On the trip I continued to read <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Feast_for_Crows">A Feast for Crows</a></em>, part of the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> series by <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/">George R. R. Martin</a> (also known as the <em>A Game of Thrones</em> series). These books are monstrous! Over a thousand pages and each subsequent book grows in length. Thus I never considered I would complete the full novel during a weeklong trip, but I did! And with days to spare.

Needless to say the story had me hooked and desperate to continue, but try as I may I couldn't find the next book in the series, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons">A Dance with Dragons</a></em>, at any local stores (where's a <a href="http://www.mystore411.com/store/listing/102/Barnes-&amp;-Noble-store-locations">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> when you need one!).

In my desperation I decided to try my once nemesis, the digital literature app Kindle for iPhone. I downloaded the app and book using 30MB of my precious 300MB data plan (very tight on a vacation trip), and began <em>A Dance of Dragons</em>.

<h2>What I Learned About Reading with the Kindle App</h2>

Reading with the Kindle app on my iPhone became fairly natural to me after a couple of hours. I did miss the feeling of a paper book in my hand, so I ordered the book using Amazon Prime when I returned home from my trip. But something strange happened after the book arrived on my doorstep a couple of days later; I never opened it! The book continues to sit on my nightstand beside my bed unopened, and to my astonishment, I continue to read on my iPhone.

Did I become accustomed to the small, glowing screen? No, I would prefer a larger area to read from. But what I have grown to love and look forward to is using the built-in <em>dictionary</em>. With a quick tap of the finger I can discover the meaning of new and obscure words that before would have been quickly passed over. Checking the meaning of a word and storing it in a notes section has turned me into an e-reader!

<h3>Reasons I like it:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Typography.</strong> I'm a designer and typography nut. Sometimes I hate reading a book because of the bad typographic choices, line-height, etc. The Kindle app offers the ability to tweak and change typography to suit my personal taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Dictionary.</strong> Overall I would say I know a lot of words or can at least infer the meaning of a word, but the app affords highlighting and definition checking! I do so as I stumble across new or interesting words and keep a list. And G.R.R.M. uses a vast, varied amount of words.</li>
    <li><strong>Perpetualilty.</strong> I have a book with me all the time in my pocket! I read a lot more now (for good or bad) instead of just at night before I go to bed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Interesting or Unknown Words</h2>
