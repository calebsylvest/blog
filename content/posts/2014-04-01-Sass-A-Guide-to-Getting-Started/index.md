Getting started in the web industry is tough, there are new tools and techniques sprouting up everyday. Keeping up with new technologies and trends and staying relevant is difficult to do. I know personally, as a younger developer, I am often overwhelmed by the vast ocean of skills required to be a competent web developer compared to the very small amount of knowledge I posses.

That's why I decided to work on a multi-post guide to getting started with my favorite language Sass. I've been working with Sass for the better part of a year now and have learned a lot but still remember the feeling of being a newcomer to the language and getting started and the difficulties involved. I had first heard of Sass about a year before I started using it, it was something I was interested in incorporating in my workflow but due to constraints like a lack of understanding and the work environment at my previous job using Sass was not possible. So let's talk about how to get started with Sass!

<h2>What is Sass?</h2>

Sass is a CSS extension language.

<h2>Common Concerns &amp; Misconceptions About Sass</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>I already know how to write CSS, I don't need a tool to do it for me.</strong> So you know how to write CSS, great! Why not write better CSS, faster! Sass will help optimize your workflow and your code, organize your stylesheets, and follow programing principles like <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html">DRY</a> and <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/">OOCSS</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I don't want to use the Command Line.</strong> Using the Command Line to run Sass really isn't difficult. We will cover a few simple Command Line arguments than anyone can handle, and we will also talk about methods of using Sass without having to use the Command Line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You need to know Rails.</strong> Nope, not at all. The only thing you need to know to properly work with Sass is CSS.</p></li>
</ol>
